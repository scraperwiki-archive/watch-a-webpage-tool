The **Watch A Webpage** tool periodically downloads a given web page URL
and compares it to the last time it was downloaded. When the page changes,
a record is saved with the date, time and the difference between the two
files.

This can be combined with an Alert tool to send an email every time a dataset
changes.

A number of example use cases:

  - see when a new article or blog post appears on an index page
  - notify when a "coming soon" page changes
  - find out when a company updates their "investor resources" page
  - discover when a competitor's product description or price changes.
  - find out when a company's board of directors is updated
